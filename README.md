# HKShowerDetection
Background iOS application in Swift that picks up on shower noise. 

STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!
--------
Used in use case scenario 2 of IoT demo. 
<br> 1. Phone listens in the background for 'shower noise'
<br> 2. Once it picks up noise, triggers event in cloud, which starts a timer.
<br> 3. If timer exceeds 5 minutes, play an alert message to OMNI speaker.

Features implemented in application 
-------
Able to confirm if the shower is running due by running background noise in comparison to ACRCloud database of custom files.
